Firefox: 
in network settings select manual proxy config then change SOCKS host to 127.0.0.1 and the port to 9050 make sure you are using SOCKS v5 and select "Proxy DNS when using SOCKS v5".
once your done using my tool set your network settings back to what you had them before or it won't work bc you aren't hosting anymore.
